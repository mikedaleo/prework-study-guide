# Prework Study Guide for Coding Bootcamp

## Description

My motivation of this project was to create an easy to use study guide to refer back to when a student of the coding bootcamp needs to access important information. 

This solves the problem of having information on many different webpages and consolidates it all onto one easy-to-use application.

I learned how to write in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript!
